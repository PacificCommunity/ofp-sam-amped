### Time series plots

Time series plots show the range of values of an indicator over time.
The outer envelope shows the 80th percentile range, and so covers most of the range of values.
The inner envelope shows the 50th percentile range.
The dashed line in the middle shows the average (median) value.

It possible to superimpose some individual trajectories on the time series plots.
These can help given an idea of the variability in time of the indicator.

Note that some indicators, e.g. the stability indicators (PIs 6 and 7), and the probability of SB/SBF=0 being below the LRP (PI 1), do not have time series plots.
