### Box plots

Box plots show the range of values of the indicator, in each time period (short-, medium- and long-term).
This means they are able present some information on the uncertainty of that indicator.

The box contains the 80th percentile range, the whiskers extend to the the 90th percentile range, and the horizontal line is average (median) value.
Note that the average value will be the same as the height of the bar charts.

The bigger the box, and the longer the whiskers, the greater the range of values of the indicator, and the less certain we are about its value.
It is generally preferred to have low uncertainty, so the smaller the box the be better.
