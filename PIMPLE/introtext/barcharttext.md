### Bar charts

Bar charts show the average (median) value of the indicator, in each time period (short-, medium- and long-term).
They are very useful for quickly comparing the average indicator values between the different MPs.
However, they only show the average value, and do not take into account any uncertainty, or information on the range of indicator values.
Uncertainty in the expected indicator values is important so the boxplots should also be looked at.
